# GITAM-AutoLogin

GITAM Auto Login is a simple python script to automate the login process of the GITAM website to make the students life easier without having the trouble of logging in when there is a timeout for every few minutes by the server. 

- This script uses selenium for python to initialize a chrome driver and login using the custom username and password given by the user. 

- After logging in the page is going to be redirected to GLearn page and it will be waiting until 5 min and going to click Attendance page and the process will repeat to make the server feel the user is still using the website without any idle behaviour.
